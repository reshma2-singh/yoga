<h1 className="text-center text-orange font-bold text-4xl  mt-8">Definition of yoga</h1>
<p className="text-xl p-4">Maharishi Patañjali (पतञ्जलि ) was a sage in ancient Tamilakam nearly 2nd century B.C., thought to bethe author of a number of Sanskrit works. The greatest  of these are the Yoga Sutras, a classical yoga text.
In the Yoga Sutras, Maharishi gave the<span className="text-xl font-bold"> definition of Yoga as-
<br/>"योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः"<br/>"Yogah-chitta-vritti-nirodhah"<br/>
</span>
-Yoga Sutra1.2<br/><span className="font-bold  text-xl " >
Which means-"Cessation(Nirodhah) of the thoughts(vritti) coming in the mind(chitta), is Yoga."</span>
<br/>But what does this really mean?
This means that in the state of trance(Samadhi) the functioning of the mind is stopped.Maharishi Patanjali
has tried to give complete information related to Samadhi to the seekers of Yoga through his Yoga Sutras.</p>

    <h1 className="text-center font-bold text-pink text-4xl mt-8"> Purpose of Yoga</h1>
    
    <p className="text-xl p-4 "> Maharishi Patanjali said "Yoga is the detention of thoughts which arrive in the mind"(YS.1.2). After that
in third sutra , Maharishi said <br/> <span className="font-bold "> "तदा द्रष्टुः स्वरुपेऽवस्थानम्" </span><br/>
<span className="font-bold">"Tada drashtuh swarupevasthanam"</span><br/> (Yoga Sutra.1.3)<br/>
<span className="font-bold">"What happens when the mind is devoid of thoughts. In that state the seer (I) becomes established in his
true nature".</span><br/>
So, the purpose of yoga is to become established in our true Nature. This is known as enlightenment.
The same thing is said in Hatha Yoga texts like Hatha Yoga Pradipika, Gheranda Samhita and Shiva
Samhita,etc.<br/><span className="font-bold">
प्रणम्य श्रीगरुुं नाथंस्वात्मारामेण योगि ना । केवलंराजयोगाय हठवि द्योपदि श्यते॥</span><br/>
"Greetings first to the guru, Yogi Swatmarama instructs the knowledge of hatha yoga only for (raja yoga)
the highest state of Yoga."-Hatha Yoga Pradipika 1.2
However, yogic lifestyle also gives us a chance to keep our physical fitness at an optimum level, along
with mental peace by the practice of asana and pranayama practices mentioned in Hatha and Raja Yoga.
This is the more known aspect of yoga now-a-days

    <p className="text-xl p-4">
    Combining the Sun channel known as pingala and the moon channel known as ida, the prana (vital force)
enters the central channel called sushumna. With the effect of prana flowing through sushumna, kundalini,
the serpent power, starts its journey from Mooladhara chakra to Sahasrara chakra. Once it reaches
Sahasrara, the yogi is absorbed in Samadhi and then called as a Siddha. This is the state of enlightenment
according to Hatha Yoga. According to Hatha Yoga pradeepika of Yogi Swatmarama, <span className="font-bold">there are 4 stages of
Hatha yoga namely-</span><br/>
<span className="font-bold">"Asana , Pranayama , Mudra & Bandha, and Samadhi."</span><br/>
According to Maharishi gheranda, <span>there are 7 limbs of Hatha Yoga namely-</span><br/>
<span className="font-bold">"Purification of the body by shatkarmas, Asana, Mudra, Pratyahara, Pranayama, Dhyana and Samadhi."</span><br/>
By following any of these systems yogi can reach enlightenment.

    <h1 className="text-center font-bold text-4xl text-pink  mt-8">History of Hatha Yoga</h1>
    <p className="text-xl p-4">Looking into the history of Hatha Yoga, its roots were related to the time when our beloved lord Shiva
gave this<span className="font-bold"> knowledge</span> to Mother Parvati in order<span className="font-bold"> to gain enlightenment.</span> After that, the great grandfather's
of Hatha Yoga like Guru Matsyendranath(direct disciple of lord shiva), very famous Guru Gorakh nath
(disciple of Matsyendranath ji) and Many more siddha yogis spread the knowledge of Hatha Yoga
through texts and Guru-disciple culture throughout India.

<h1 className="text-center font-bold text-4xl text-orange mt-8">Raja Yoga</h1>
<p className="text-xl p-4">
Raja yoga is also known as <span className="font-bold">Ashtanga yoga</span>(Given by Maharishi Patanjali) because it talks about the 8
limbs/steps in order to attain the state of Samadhi, namely-
"Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi."
<br/><span className="font-bold">Living life according to the Ashtanga system gives us mental peace and contentment even if we have no
higher purpose of practicing it.</span><br/>
Hatha Yoga and Raja Yoga look different but are somehow taking us to the same state of samadhi or
trance,or whatever you like to say.

<h1 className="text-center font-bold text-4xl text-pink mt-8"> Purpose of Yama and Niyama</h1>
<p className="text-xl p-4">The purpose of Yama and Niyama is to control the mind by avoiding major problems we have gathered
during our wrong practices in the world. <span className="font-bold">There are 5 Yamas and 5 Niyamas. They are Yamas-<br/> Ahimsa (Non-violence), Satya(Truth), Asteya(Non-stealing), Brahmacharya(Celibacy) and
Aparigrah (Keeping only very necessary things)Niyamas- Shauch(cleanliness), Santosh(contentment), Tapa(penance), Swadhyaya(Study about
the truth) and Ishwar Pranidhana(surrender to God).</span><br/>
The Yamas are called as the greatest fast which needs to be followed all the time, at all places, in all
situations at three levels- by the body, by speech and by the mind.

<h1 className="text-center font-bold text-4xl text-orange mt-8">How does Yoga benefit everyone?</h1>
<p className="text-xl p-4"><span className="font-bold">Asanas(physical postures) are helpful in gaining equilibrium at body level</span> because we are bending,
twisting & stretching the body in many ways. This<span className="font-bold"> bending-twisting brings harmony and strength in the
different body organs and various glands due to which our overall health is improved.</span> Also, practicing
meditative asanas like the Padmasana, siddhasana,etc. have a great effect on our will power.<br/>
<span className="font-bold">"When the posture is proven, there is no trauma of dualities (pleasure-sadness, loss-benefit, cold-heat,
hunger-thirst,etc)."</span><br/>
Yoga Sutra 2.48 <br/>First we perfect the asana(see image), and then we start doing <span className="font-bold">Pranayama.</span> Pranayama means breaking the
general flow of inhalation and exhalation by doing "kumbhak" or retention of breath.Various Pranayama (Breathing retention techniques) are known for their therapeutic benefits at a much
deeper level after perfecting asanas. It is said in Hatha Yoga texts that <span className="font-bold">by practicing pranayama, our
channels are purified and all the diseases are eradicated from the body.</span></p></div>
<div className="bg-lightpink mr-2 ml-2 shadow-2xl">
<h1 className="text-center font-bold text-pink text-4xl mt-8">How does it impact our mind?</h1>
<p className="text-xl p-4">Once we start going through our yoga practice, with time, we get healthier at body level due to which our
breathing pattern starts to get deeper and deeper. In Hatha Yoga texts, it is said<br/><span className="font-bold"> "As long as the breath is
flowing, the mind is working too.Once the breath stops, the mind will also stop."</span> <br/> From this statement, it
is concluded by geniuses of yoga that if our breath slows, the mind also starts to calm down. <span className="font-bold">With a calm
mind, we can focus, concentrate and meditate more easily.</span></p>
</div>
<div className="bg-gold mr-2 ml-2 shadow-2xl">
<h1 className="text-center font-bold text-orange text-4xl mt-8">What is Pratyahara?
</h1>
<p className="text-xl p-4">Maharishi Patanjali said <br/><span className="font-bold">"Withdrawal of the senses from their subjects, and their absorption in the mind is
Pratyahara".</span><br/>- Yoga Sutra 2.54.<br/> This is known as the bridge which takes one from the level of the body to
the next level, i.e mind.<br/>
<span className="font-bold">"Once Pratyahara is mastered,Yogi attains ultimate captivity on his senses."</span><br/> - Yoga Sutra 2.55<br/>
Due to which yogi can fix his mind on anything.
</p></div>
<div className="bg-lightpink mr-2 ml-2 shadow-2xl">
<h1 className="text-center font-bold text-4xl text-pink mt-8">What is Dharana & Dhyana?
</h1>
<p className="text-xl p-4">Meditation or Dhyana is the seventh limb of Ashtanga yoga of Maharishi Patanjali. Maharishi Patanjali
said<br/><span className="font-bold"> "When the mind is fixed at a point inside our body, it is called Dharana."</span><br/> Yoga Sutra 3.1 ,<br/> for
example at the eyebrow center.<br/><span className="font-bold"> "When this dharana is prolonged at the same point, it becomes Dhyana."</span><br/>
Yoga Sutra 3.2.<br/>
This is the easiest definition of<span className="font-bold"> meditation</span> and nothing much is required to say about that. It is something
which is experienced once you are perfected in the previous six limbs</p></div>
<div className="bg-gold mr-2 ml-2 mb-4 shadow-2xl">
<h1 className="text-center font-bold text-4xl text-orange  mt-8">What is Samadhi?
</h1>
<p className="text-xl p-4 ">Samadhi,also known as the transcendental state, is the result of very long meditation(7-8 to infinite
hours). In Hatha Yoga Pradipika, Yogi Swatmarama said-<br/><span className="font-bold">"As the salt is totally dissolved in water,
similarly the mind is absorbed in the soul. This is Samadhi. The state of no mind."</span><br/>
Lot of penance is required to reach there. All the human problems are solved once we get perfected in
Samadhi</p>
