            <p className="text-xl p-4 ">The Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā (Sanskrit: haṭhayogapradīpikā, हठयोगप्रदीपि का or Light on Hatha
Yoga) is a classic fifteenth-century Sanskrit manual on haṭha yoga, written by Svātmārāma, who
connects the teaching's lineage to Matsyendranath of the Nathas. It is among the most
influential surviving texts on haṭha yoga, being one of the three classic texts alongside the
Gheranda Samhita and the Shiva SamhitaSvātmārāma incorporates older Sanskrit concepts into his synthesis. He introduces his system
as a preparatory stage for physical purification before higher meditation or Raja Yoga.
The Hatha Yoga Pradīpikā lists thirty-five earlier Haṭha Yoga masters (siddhas), including Ādi
Nātha, Matsyendranāth and Gorakṣanāth. The work consists of 389 shlokas (verses) in four
chapters that describe topics including purification (ṣaṭkarma), posture (āsana), breath control
(prāṇāyāma), spiritual centres in the body (chakra), coiled power (kuṇḍalinī), force postures
(bandha), energy (śakti), channels of the subtle body (nāḍī), and symbolic gestures (mudrā).<br/>
<span className="font-bold">Chapter 1</span> deals with setting the proper environment for yoga, the ethical duties of a yogi, and
the asanas.<br/>
<span className="font-bold">Chapter 2 </span>deals with pranayama and the shatkarmas.<br/>
<span className="font-bold">Chapter 3</span> discusses the mudras and their benefits.<br/>
<span className="font-bold">Chapter 4</span> deals with meditation , Naad anusandhan(research of the divine sound inside)and
samadhi as a journey of personal spiritual growth.<br/>
It runs in the line of Hindu yoga (as opposed to the Buddhist and Jain traditions) and is
dedicated to The First Lord (Ādi Nātha), one of the names of Lord Śiva (the Hindu god of
destruction and renewal). He is described in several texts from the Dattātreyayogaśāstra
onwards as having imparted the secret of haṭha yoga to his divine consort Pārvatī.

        <p className="text-xl p-4 ">
        Gheranda Samhita (Gheraṇḍasaṁhitā, घेरंडसहिं हिता, meaning “Gheranda's collection”) is a
Sanskrit text of Yoga in Hinduism. It is one of the three classic texts of hatha yoga (the other two
being the Hatha Yoga Pradipika and the Shiva Samhita), and one of the most encyclopedic
treatises in yoga.It is likely a late 17th-century text, probably from northeast India, structured as
a teaching manual based on a dialogue between Gheranda and Chanda.The text is organized
into seven chapters and contains 351 shlokas (verses).<br/>
<span className="font-bold"> Purification through Shatkarma, firmness through postures, stability through postures,
patience through pratyahara, laghava through pranayama, direct vision of the object through
meditation and detached attachment from samadhi. By practicing in this sequence, salvation is
definitely attained in the end.</span><br/>
(Gheranda samhita chapter 1, verse 10-11)
The Gheranda Samhita calls itself a book on ghatastha yoga, which literally means "vessel
yoga", wherein the body and mind are depicted as vessels that carry and serve the soul (atman,
purusha). It is generally considered as a Hatha yoga text. The text teaches a seven limbed yoga
in its seven chapters.<br/>
<span className="font-bold">Chapter 1</span> deals with Purification techniques i.e, shatkarmas.<br/>
<span className="font-bold">Chapter 2</span> deals with 32 asanas for increasing strength of the body.<br/>
<span className="font-bold">Chapter 3 </span>deals with 25 types of mudras.<br/>
<span className="font-bold">Chapter 4</span> talks about 8 types of Pranayama.<br/>
<span className="font-bold">Chapter 5</span> talks about Pratyahara or sense withdrawal.<br/>
<span className="font-bold">Chapter 6</span> talks about stages of Dhyana or meditation.<br/>
<span className="font-bold">Chapter 7</span> gives knowledge about 6 types of Samadhi.<br/>
It declares its goal to be the perfection of an individual's body, mind and soul through a seven
step lifelong continuous self-development.

</h1>
            <p className="text-xl p-4 ">Shiva Samhita (Shivasaṃhitā, also Siva Samhita, meaning "Shiva's Compendium") is a Sanskrit
text on yoga, written by an unknown author. The text is addressed by the Hindu god Shiva to his
consort Parvati. The text consists of five chapters, with<br/><span className="font-bold"> the first chapter a treatise that
summarizes nondual Vedanta (Advaita Vedanta) philosophy with influences from the Sri Vidya
school of South India.</span><br/> <span className="font-bold">The remaining chapters discuss yoga, the importance of a guru (teacher)
to a student, various asanas, mudras and siddhis (powers) attainable with yoga and tantra.</span><br/>
The Shiva Samhita is one of three major surviving classical treatises on hatha yoga, the other
two being Gheranda Samhita and Hatha Yoga Pradipika. It is considered the most
comprehensive treatise on hatha yoga, one that recommends that all householders practice and
benefit from yoga.
The Shiva Samhita talks about the complex physiology, names 84 different asanas (only four of
which are described in detail), describes five specific types of prana, and provides techniques to
regulate them.It also deals with abstract yogic philosophy, mudras, tantric practices, and
meditation. The text states that a householder can practice yoga and benefit from it.

                <p className="text-xl p-4 ">The Goraksha Śataka (Sanskrit: गोरक्षशतक, "Goraksha's Hundred") is an early hatha yoga text,
written in around the 10th century in the tantra tradition. Mahayogi Guru Gorakhnath Ji wrote
this text which contains 100 sanskrit verses to explain the process of gaining samadhi.<br/>
Verse 7 of Goraksha shataka says-<br/><span className="font-bold ">
आसनं प्राणसंरोधः प्रत्याहारश्च धारणा।<br/> ध्यानं समाधिरेतानि योगाङ्गानि भवन्ति षट् ॥</span><br/>
<span className="font-semibold">"Fixed postures, the suppression of the vital air, withdrawal of the senses, the directed attention,
fixing mind on a single object, and being established in the state of the True Self constitute the
Six Limbs of Yoga."</span><br/>
The Goraksha Śataka, unlike Ashtanga, the eightfold yoga of Patanjali, describes a system of
six limbs: asana (posture), breath-restraint (which it calls pranasamrodha), pratyahara
(withdrawal), dharana (concentration), meditation, and samadhi; omitting the first two limbs of
Ashtanga, namely the Yamas and Niyamas. It recommends gradually increasing breath
retention as the best way to samadhi.

                <p className="text-xl p-4 ">Guru Gorakhnath, the Mahayogi, wrote this book as a guide to seekers of the Supreme Truth.
It is structured as 6 Upadeshas or Lessons:<br/>
<span className="font-bold">1. Pindotpatti</span> – It details the origin of the body, defines & differentiates the cosmic and physical
bodies. It also provides a detailed understanding of the Brahmanda or Samasti Pinda or the
Supreme Spirit and how everything emerges from this Supreme Reality<br/>
<span className="font-bold">2.Pinda-Vicara</span> – This lesson gives details of the constitution of the body, not as a physical
organism, but about the subtle elements like the Chakras, Adharas, Lakshya and Vyoma. It
teaches how to deeply contemplate on these and use the deep insights to evolve the physical
body from a purely physical to a more dematerialized, spiritualized form or what is called Kaya
Siddhi. It emphasizes the role of the guru being critical and irreplaceable on this path.<br/>
<span className="font-bold">3.Pinda Sambitti</span> – The linkage of the individual body with the cosmic body, relationship between
the microcosm and macrocosm is explained. The path to the yogic objective of attaining perfect
freedom & bliss and experiencing oneness with the Universe is explained here.<br/>
<span className="font-bold">4.Pindadhara</span> – Herein, Guru Gorakhnath, talks about the role of Shakti, the Supreme Spiritual
power within which all life is contained and which also sustains life. It also explains the siva-sakti
relationship<br/>
<span className="font-bold">5. Samarasa Karana</span> – This lesson is dedicated to perfect unification of the individual body with
the cosmic body and the way to attain the same. The Guru says that it is in this stage that the
difference between the finite and infinite disappears. The practitioner now gets an illumine
consciousness which experiences bliss and unity with the Supreme<br/>
<span className="font-bold">6.Avadhuta Yogi</span> –The 6th lesson is dedicated to the individual who has attained Samarasa
Karana and is called the Avadhuta Yogi. It explains the character and conduct of such an
attained being. This Avadhuta lives in a state of elevated consciousness / super consciousness
and becomes a master of himself and his circumstances. In this attained person, have
awakened all the latent spiritual and mental powers which lie completely dormant in normal
people. It is through these powers that he/she is able to take complete control of his life and all
its circumstances. Hence, quite often these yogis were seen to have magical powers by
ordinary people.
